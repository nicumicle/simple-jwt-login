== Description ==

Simple JWT Login is a FREE WordPress plugin that allows you to use a JWT on WordPress REST endpoints.

This plugin allows you to log in, register, authenticate, delete and change user password to a WordPress website using a JWT.

It's main purpose is to allow you to connect a mobile App or other websites with WordPress.

Check the plugin [website](https://simplejwtlogin.com) for more features.

== Login User ==

This plugin is customizable and offers you multiple methods to log in to you website, based on multiple scenarios.

In order to login, users have to send JWT. The plugin, validates the JWT, and if everything is OK, it can extract the WordPress email address or user ID.
Users can specify the exact key of the JWT payload where this information can be found.

Here are the methods how you can send the JWT in order to auto-login:

1. URL
2. Header
3. Cookie
4. Session

If the JWT is present in multiple places ( like URL and Header), the JWT will be overwritten.

This plugin supports multiple JWT Decryption algorithms, like: HS256, HS512, HS384, RS256,RS384 and RS512.

After the user is logged in you can automatically redirect the user to a page like:

- Dashboard
- Homepage
- or any other custom Page ( this is mainly used for redirecting users to a landing page)

You can attach to your redirect a URL parameter `redirectUrl` that will be used for redirect instead of the defined ones.
In order to use this, you have to enable it by checking the option `Allow redirect to a specific URL`.

Also, redirect after login offers some variables that you can use in the customURL and redirectUrl.
Here are the variables which you can use in your URL:
- {{site_url}} : Site URL
- {{user_id}} : Logged in user ID
- {{user_email}} : Logged in user email
- {{user_login}} : Logged in username
- {{user_first_name}} : User first name
- {{user_last_name}} : User last name
- {{user_nicename}} : User nice name

You can generate dynamic URLs with these variables, and, before the redirect, the specific value will be replaced.

Here is an example:

``
    http://yourdomain.com?param1={{user_id}}&param2={{user_login}}
`` 

Also, this plugin allows you to limit the auto-login based on the client IP address.
If you are concerned about security, you can limit the auto-login only from some IP addresses.

[Read more](https://simplejwtlogin.com/docs/autologin/) on our website. 

== Register Users ==

This plugin also allows you to create WordPress users.

This option is disabled by default, but you can enable it at any time.

In order to create users, you just have to make a POST request to the route URL, and send an *email* and a *password* as parameter and the new user will be created.

You can select the type for the new users: editor, author, contributor, subscriber, etc.

Also, you can limit the user creating only for specific IP addresses, or  specific email domains.

Another cool option is "Generate a random password when a new user is created".
If this option is selected, the password is no more required when a new user is created a random password will be generated.

Another option that you have for register user is "Initialize force login after register".
When the user registration is completed, the user will continue on the flow configured on login config.

If auto-login is disabled, this feature will not work and the register user will go on a normal flow and return a json response.

If you want to add custom user_meta on user creation, just add the parameter `user_meta` with a json. This will create user_meta for the new user.

``
{
    "meta_key":"meta_value",
    "meta_key2":"meta_value"
}
``

These properties can be passed in the request when the new user is created.

- **email** : (required) (string)  The user email address.
- **password** :  (required) (string) The plain-text user password.
- **user_login** : (string) The user's login username.
- **user_nicename** : (string) The URL-friendly username.
- **user_url** : (string) The user URL.
- **display_name** : (string) The user's display name. Default is the user's username.
- **nickname** : (string) The user's nickname. Default is the user's username.
- **first_name** : (string) The user's first name. For new users, will be used to build the first part of the user's display name if $display_name is not specified.
- **last_name** : (string) The user's last name. For new users, will be used to build the second part of the user's display name if $display_name is not specified.
- **description** : (string) The user's biographical description.
- **rich_editing** : (string) Whether to enable the rich-editor for the user. Accepts 'true' or 'false' as a string literal, not boolean. Default 'true'.
- **syntax_highlighting** : (string) Whether to enable the rich code editor for the user. Accepts 'true' or 'false' as a string literal, not boolean. Default 'true'.
- **comment_shortcuts** : (string) Whether to enable comment moderation keyboard shortcuts for the user. Accepts 'true' or 'false' as a string literal, not boolean. Default 'false'.
- **admin_color** : (string) Admin color scheme for the user. Default 'fresh'.
- **use_ssl** : (bool) Whether the user should always access the admin over https. Default false.
- **user_registered** : (string) Date the user registered. Format is `Y-m-d H:m:s`.
- **user_activation_key** : (string) Password reset key. Default empty.
- **spam** : (bool) Multisite only. Whether the user is marked as spam. Default false.
- **show_admin_bar_front** : (string) Whether to display the Admin Bar for the user on the site's front end. Accepts 'true' or 'false' as a string literal, not boolean. Default 'true'.
- **locale** : (string) User's locale. Default empty.

== Delete User ==

Delete user it is disabled by default.

In order to delete a user, you have to configure where to search the details in the JWT.
You can delete users by WordPress User ID or by Email address.

Also, you have to choose the JWT parameter key where email or user ID it is stored in the JWT.

Also, you can limit the deletion of users to specific IP addresses for security reasons.

== Reset Password ==

Reset password and change password endpoints are disabled by default.

This plugin allows you to send the reset password endpoint, just by calling an endpoint. An email with the code will be sent to a specific email address.

Also, you are able to customize this email, or even not send at email at all.

The change password endpoint, changes the user password, based on the reset password code.

[Read More](https://simplejwtlogin.com/docs/delete-user/) on our website.

== Authentication ==

This plugin allows users to generate JWT tokens based from WordPress user email and password.

In order to Get a new JWT, just make a POST request to */auth* route with your WordPress email and password ( or password_hash) and the response will look something like this:

``
     {
         "success": true,
         "data": {
             "jwt": "NEW_GENERATED_JWT_HERE"
         }
     }
``

If you want to add extra parameters in the JWT payload, just send the parameter `payload` on `/auth` endpoint, and add a json with the values you want to be added in the payload.

At some point, the JWT will expire.
So, if you want to renew it without having to ask again for user and password, you will have to make a POST request to the *auth/refresh* route.

This will generate a response with a new JWT, similar to the one that `/auth` generates.

If you want to get some details about a JWT, and validate that JWT, you can call `/auth/validate`. If you have a valid JWT, details about the available WordPress user will be returned, and some JWT details.

If you want to revoke a JWT, access `/auth/revoke` and send the `jwt` as a parameter.

The plugin auto-generates the example URL you might need to test these scenarios.

[Read More](https://simplejwtlogin.com/docs/authentication/) on our website.

== Auth codes ==

Auth codes are optional, but you can enable them for Auto-login, Register User and Delete user.

This feature allows you to add a layer of protection to your API routes.

The Auth codes contains 3 parts:
1. Authentication Key: This is the actual code that you have to add in the request.
2. WordPress new User Role: can be used when you want to create multiple user types with the create user endpoint. If you leave it blank, the value configured in the 'Register Settings' will be used.
3. Expiration Date: This allows you to set an expiration date for you auth codes. The format is `Y-M-D H:m:s'. Example : 2020-12-24 23:00:00. If you leave it blank, it will never expire.

Expiration date format: year-month-day hours:minutes:seconds

== Hooks ==

This plugin allows advanced users to link some hooks with the plugin and perform some custom scripts.
Some available hooks:

- **simple_jwt_login_login_hook**
  - type: action
  - parameters: Wp_User $user
  - description: This hook it is called after the user has been logged in. 
  
- **simple_jwt_login_redirect_hook**
  - type: action

View full list of hooks on [https://simplejwtlogin.com/docs/hooks](https://simplejwtlogin.com/docs/hooks).

== CORS ==

The CORS standard it is needed because it allows servers to specify who can access its assets and how the assets can be accessed.
Cross-origin requests are made using the standard HTTP request methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

[Read More](https://simplejwtlogin.com/docs/cors/) on our website.

== Protect endpoints ==

This option is disabled by default. In order to enable it, you need to set "Protect endpoints enabled" to true.

This feature comes with 2 actions:
- Apply on All REST Endpoints
- Apply only on specific REST endpoints

When you choose `Apply on All REST Endpoints`, you will be able to whitelist some endpoints from your WordPress REST by adding them to the whitelist section.
For example, If you only want to allow users to access the `wp/v2/posts` endpoint without having to provide the JWT, you save in the whitelist section `wp/v2/posts`

When you choose `Apply only on specific endpoints`, you will have to add all the endpoints you want to be protected by JWT.

When an endpoint is protected, and you don't provide a JWT, you will get the following response:

``
{
   "success":false,
   "data":{
      "message":"Your are not authorized to access this endpoint.",
      "errorCode":403,
      "type":"simple-jwt-login-route-protect"
   }
}
``

== Installation ==

Here's how you install and activate the JWT-login plugin:

1. Download the Simple-JWT-login plugin.
2. Upload the .zip file in your WordPress plugin directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.

or

1. Go to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress and click 'Add New'
2. Search for 'Simple JWT Login' and select 'Install Now'
3. Activate the plugin when prompted

Next steps:

- Go to "General section"
    - set "JWT Decryption key". With this key, we will validate the JWT.
    - choose "JWT Decryption algorithm".

- Go to "Login Settings"
    - please set "Allow Auto-login" to "yes".
    - set parameter "Action" ( Login by WordPress User ID / User Email).
    - set the "JWT parameter key" with the key from your JWT where user email or user ID can be found in the decoded JWT.

After that, you can copy the sample URL from the top of the page ( Login Config section), replace the JWT string with your valid JWT, and you will be redirected to your WordPress and automatically logged in.

Also, if you don't want to add the JWT in the URL, you can add it in the header of the request with the key 'Authorization'.
Please note that the JWT that is set in the header overwrites the one from the URL.

Example:

``
Authorization: Bearer YOURJWTTOKEN
``

or

``
Authorization: YOURJWTTOKEN
``

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin secure? =
Yes, this plugin is secure. It allows to auto-login to your WordPress website using a JWT, that is decrypted and validated against your JWT Decryption key.
Make sure you set the specific user type when new users are created.

= Can I disable the API for registering new users? =
Yes, both Auto-login and register can be enabled or disabled.

= Can I limit the email addresses that can register in WordPress with this plugin? =
Yes, You can use the domain limitation and add multiple domains separated by comma.
Users that don't provide an email from that domain, will get an error.

= Can I use a JWT generated by another plugin to login? =
Yes. The only thing you have to make sure, in order to work, is that you use the same "Decryption Key" and encryption algorithm.

= Is the Auth Code required? =
No, it is not required. You can disable it from 'Login config', 'Register Config' and 'Delete User Config'. Just set the parameter 'Login|Register requires Auth Code' to 'No'.

= I don't want other users to be able to delete users. What should I do? =
The 'delete users option' is disabled by default. To make sure nobody will delete a user, please make sure the option "Allow Delete" is set to "No".

=Can I automatically log in to a WordPress website from my mobile App using this plugin?=
Yes. The main feature of this plugin is to automatically log in users into a WordPress website using a JWT. So, you can log in into WordPress from mobile apps, react native, angular, Vue js, meteor, backbone, javascript, etc.

= How to use hooks? =

Here is a code example, how to send an email after a new user has been created.

``
    add_action( 'simple_jwt_login_register_hook', function($user, $password){
   	    $to      = $user->user_email;
   	    $subject = 'Welcome';
   	    $message = '
                   Welcome to My Site. Your new user credentials are: 
                   email: ' . $to .'
                   password: '. $password;
   	    wp_mail($to, $subject, $message);
       }, 10, 2);
``

Here is an example on how you can overwrite the "No Redirect" response after autologin:
``
    add_filter('simple_jwt_login_no_redirect_message',function($response, $request){
        $response['userId'] = get_current_user_id();
        $response['userDetails'] = wp_get_current_user();
        return $response;
    },10, 2);
``

Here is an example, on how you can change the body for reset password email template:
``
    add_filter('simple_jwt_login_reset_password_custom_email_template',
    function ($template, $request) {
            $template .= 'The template has been modified by hook';
            return $template;
        },
        10,
        2
    );
``

= I cannot get the JWT from session. Where should I store the JWT? =
The plugin searches for the JWT in:
- URL ( &jwt=YOUR JWT HERE)
- SESSION (  ` $_SESSION['simple-jwt-login-token'] `)
- COOKIE ( ` $_COOKIE['simple-jwt-login-token'] ` )
- Header ( ` Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_HERE `)

Also, the key name for each parameter, can be changed in the general section.

= I would like to create users with different roles. It is possible? =
Yes. In order to be able to create different users with different roles, first you have to create some AUTH Codes, and set the desired roles for each Auth Code.
After that, for the create user route, simply add the AUTH code in the request, and the role from 'Register User' will be overwritten with the one from Auth Code.
